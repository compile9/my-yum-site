## Project Overview

**[qqb.kitchen](https://qqb.kitchen/)** is a containerized web application featuring a <code style="color : darkorange">**Java**</code> Spring Boot backend 
with <code style="color : blue">**PostgreSQL**</code> database and a <code style="color : fuchsia">**React**</code>/<code style="color : greenyellow">**TypeScript**</code> frontend. 
The infrastructure leverages <code style="color : cyan">**Docker**</code> for containerization and orchestration, 
with deployment automated through a <code style="color : green">**CI/CD**</code> pipeline that builds and pushes custom images to DockerHub, 
then deploys them alongside PostgreSQL to <code style="color : gold">**Amazon Web Services (AWS)**</code>. 
A shell script executes the Docker Compose configuration to orchestrate proper container initialization sequence. This architecture enables consistent, 
reliable deployments across environments while development continues on new features and enhancements.

## Tech Stack
- <code style="color : magenta">**Frontend**</code>: React, TypeScript
- <code style="color : gold">**Backend**</code>: Java Spring Boot (including custom RESTful APIs development)
- <code style="color : cyan">**Database**</code>: PostgreSQL (with PL/pgSQL for stored procedures and functions)
- <code style="color : green">**DevOps**</code>: Docker (containerization and orchestration), AWS (EC2, Route 53, IAM), Shell Scripting (automation), GitHub Actions (CI/CD pipelines)
